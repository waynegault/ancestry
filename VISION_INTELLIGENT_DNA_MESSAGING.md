## Current State Assessment

### What's Working Well ‚úÖ

**Action 8 - Automated Messaging**:
- ‚úÖ Differential messaging (in-tree vs out-of-tree templates)
- ‚úÖ Message sequencing (Initial ‚Üí Follow-Up ‚Üí Final Reminder)
- ‚úÖ Desist functionality (respects "do not contact" requests)
- ‚úÖ Template selection based on confidence and A/B testing
- ‚úÖ Dry run mode for safe testing
- ‚úÖ 44,376+ messages successfully created and managed

**Action 9 - Productive Message Processing**:
- ‚úÖ AI-powered message classification (PRODUCTIVE, DESIST, OTHER)
- ‚úÖ Genealogical entity extraction (names, dates, places, relationships)
- ‚úÖ Microsoft To-Do task creation for follow-up research
- ‚úÖ Basic acknowledgment message sending
- ‚úÖ DeepSeek AI integration with multi-provider abstraction

**Supporting Infrastructure**:
- ‚úÖ Action 10: GEDCOM file analysis with relationship path calculation
- ‚úÖ Action 11: API-based genealogical research
- ‚úÖ Universal scoring system for person matching
- ‚úÖ DNA ethnicity tracking in database
- ‚úÖ Comprehensive conversation logging
- ‚úÖ Rate limiting and error handling

### Current Limitations üîß

1. **Limited Dialogue Intelligence**: Action 9 sends mostly generic acknowledgments, not substantive genealogical responses
2. **No Person Lookup Integration**: Doesn't use Action 10/11 to research people mentioned in messages
3. **Missing Relationship Context**: Responses don't include relationship paths or family details
4. **Unused DNA Data**: Ethnicity commonality not mentioned in messages
5. **Basic Tree Statistics**: Doesn't communicate "You're one of X matches in my tree"
6. **Static Follow-up Timing**: Uses fixed intervals, not engagement-based adaptation
7. **Limited Context Memory**: Doesn't maintain rich conversation state across exchanges

---

## Vision Statement

**Create an AI-powered genealogical research assistant that conducts intelligent, contextually-aware conversations with DNA matches, automatically researching family connections and providing substantive genealogical insights while respecting user preferences and managing conversation lifecycle.**

### Core Principles

1. **Intelligent & Helpful**: Provide real genealogical value in every response
2. **Contextually Aware**: Remember conversation history and adapt accordingly
3. **Respectful**: Honor do-not-contact preferences immediately
4. **Research-Driven**: Use Action 10/11 to look up people and relationships
5. **Data-Rich**: Leverage DNA ethnicity, tree statistics, and relationship paths
6. **Adaptive**: Adjust messaging when tree status changes (out-of-tree ‚Üí in-tree)
7. **Task-Oriented**: Create actionable research tasks from new information

---

## Core Capabilities

### 1. Intelligent Initial Outreach

**Current**: Template-based messages with basic personalization  
**Enhanced**:

- **In-Tree Matches**: Include specific relationship path
  - *"Hello cousin! According to my research, you're my 3rd cousin 1x removed. Our connection is: You ‚Üí [parent] ‚Üí [grandparent] ‚Üí [common ancestor] ‚Üê [my ancestor] ‚Üê [my parent] ‚Üê Me. I'd love to verify this with you!"*
  
- **Out-of-Tree Matches**: Include tree statistics and DNA commonality
  - *"Hello! We're DNA matches (predicted 4th-6th cousin, sharing 45 cM). You're one of 2,500 DNA matches I have, but only 850 are in my tree so far. We both have significant Scottish ancestry (you: 35%, me: 42%). Would you like to explore our connection?"*

- **Dynamic Template Selection**: Use AI to select best template variant based on:
  - DNA confidence (cM shared, predicted relationship)
  - Tree status and relationship complexity
  - Last login activity (recent vs inactive users)
  - Ethnicity overlap

### 2. Conversational Dialogue Engine

**Current**: Generic acknowledgments for productive messages  
**Enhanced**:

**Person Mention Detection & Lookup**:
- When recipient mentions: *"My grandfather was John Smith, born 1850 in Aberdeen"*
- System automatically:
  1. Extracts: John Smith, male, b. 1850, Aberdeen
  2. Searches using Action 10 (GEDCOM) and Action 11 (API)
  3. Generates response:
     - **Found**: *"I have John Smith (1850-1920) in my tree! He's my 3rd great-grandfather. His parents were William Smith and Mary Fraser. He married Jane Robertson in 1875. Is this the same person?"*
     - **Not Found**: *"I don't have a John Smith born 1850 in Aberdeen in my tree yet. My Aberdeen ancestors include the Gault, Fraser, and Milne families. Do you know if John Smith connected to any of these families?"*

**Relationship Path Responses**:
- For in-tree matches: Always include relationship path in responses
- For newly-added matches: *"Great news! I've added you to my tree. You're my 2nd cousin 2x removed through our common ancestor Margaret Fraser (1820-1890)."*

**DNA Ethnicity Commonality**:
- *"We both have strong connections to North East Scotland (you: 28%, me: 35%) and Galicia (southeast Poland/western Ukraine) (you: 12%, me: 15%). This suggests our common ancestor likely came from the Aberdeen/Banff area."*

**Tree Statistics Context**:
- *"You're one of 850 DNA matches I've successfully placed in my tree out of 2,500 total matches. Your connection helps fill in the Fraser family line."*

### 3. Adaptive Message Sequencing

**Current**: Fixed timing (Initial ‚Üí Follow-Up ‚Üí Final Reminder)  
**Enhanced**:

**Engagement-Based Timing**:
- **Active Users** (logged in <7 days): Faster follow-up (7 days)
- **Moderate Users** (logged in 7-30 days): Standard follow-up (14 days)
- **Inactive Users** (logged in >30 days): Slower follow-up (21 days)
- **Never Logged In**: Single message only, no follow-ups

**Status Change Adaptation**:
- When out-of-tree match becomes in-tree:
  - Cancel pending out-of-tree follow-ups
  - Send new in-tree message: *"Update! I've found our connection. You're my [relationship] through [common ancestor]. Here's our relationship path: [path]"*

**Conversation Continuity**:
- If recipient replies between scheduled messages, cancel automated follow-ups
- Switch to conversational mode with AI-generated responses

### 4. Do-Not-Contact Management

**Current**: Desist acknowledgment message  
**Enhanced**:

**Immediate Recognition**:
- Detect phrases: "stop", "unsubscribe", "not interested", "do not contact"
- Update Person.status to DESIST immediately
- Send polite acknowledgment: *"I completely understand and respect your preference. I've updated my records and won't contact you again. Thank you for letting me know!"*
- Cancel all pending messages
- Log reason for future analysis

**Proactive Preference Detection**:
- Detect soft signals: "I'm not interested in genealogy", "too busy right now"
- Mark for reduced contact frequency
- Offer opt-out: *"I understand you're busy. Would you prefer I don't send follow-up messages? Just let me know!"*

### 5. Genealogical Research Assistant

**Current**: Basic entity extraction and task creation  
**Enhanced**:

**Multi-Person Lookup**:
- When recipient mentions multiple people: *"My grandparents were John Smith and Mary Jones, married in 1920"*
- System searches for both individuals
- Generates comprehensive response with all findings
- Creates relationship diagram if both found

**Source Citation**:
- Include source references in responses: *"According to my tree, John Smith (1850-1920) is documented in the 1881 Scotland Census (Banff, Aberdeenshire) and his death certificate (1920, Aberdeen)."*

**Research Suggestions**:
- *"Based on our connection, you might find these records helpful: [list of relevant Ancestry collections]. Would you like me to share specific records I've found for our common ancestors?"*

**Automated Task Creation**:
- Extract new genealogical information from messages
- Create Microsoft To-Do tasks with:
  - Person name and details
  - Source (message from [username])
  - Suggested action (verify, add to tree, find records)
  - Priority based on relationship closeness

### 6. Conversation State Management

**Enhanced Database Schema**:

```sql
-- New table: conversation_state
CREATE TABLE conversation_state (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    people_id INTEGER FOREIGN KEY,
    conversation_phase TEXT,  -- 'initial_outreach', 'active_dialogue', 'research_exchange', 'concluded'
    engagement_score INTEGER,  -- 0-100 based on response quality and frequency
    last_topic TEXT,  -- 'relationship_verification', 'person_lookup', 'dna_discussion'
    pending_questions TEXT,  -- JSON array of unanswered questions
    mentioned_people TEXT,  -- JSON array of people discussed
    shared_ancestors TEXT,  -- JSON array of confirmed common ancestors
    next_action TEXT,  -- 'await_reply', 'send_follow_up', 'research_needed', 'no_action'
    next_action_date DATETIME,
    created_at DATETIME,
    updated_at DATETIME
);
```

**Conversation Phases**:
1. **Initial Outreach**: First contact, awaiting response
2. **Active Dialogue**: Back-and-forth conversation in progress
3. **Research Exchange**: Sharing genealogical data and sources
4. **Concluded**: Conversation naturally ended or desist requested

- **Test Accounts**: Practice with real conversations between Wayne Gault and Frances Milne/Mchardy
- **Test Database**: Create isolated test database with just Frances for testing
- **Validation**: Test each phase before proceeding to next

### Implementation Approach ‚úÖ
- **Sequence**: Implement all phases sequentially (not parallel)
- **Scope**: Implement everything as described in this vision document
- **Commits**: Git commit at completion of each phase
- **Testing**: Comprehensive testing before phase completion

### AI Provider Strategy ‚úÖ
- **Current**: Continue with DeepSeek for Phases 1-6
- **Future**: Add Local LLM as Phase 7 (final phase)
- **Hardware**: Dell XPS 15 9520 (i9-12900HK, 64GB RAM, RTX 3050 Ti 4GB)
- **Rationale**: Determine LLM requirements first, then select compatible model

### Open Questions (To Be Determined During Implementation)

1. **Message Frequency**: Maximum messages per day in production?
   - Suggested: 50-100 per day to avoid overwhelming recipients

2. **Engagement Thresholds**: When to stop messaging?
   - After 3 unanswered messages (current)?
   - Based on engagement score <20?
   - After X days of inactivity?

3. **Tree Statistics**: Specific numbers or vague?
   - "You're one of 850 matches in my tree" (specific)
   - "You're one of many matches I've placed in my tree" (vague)

4. **Ethnicity Sharing**: Detail level?
   - High-level regions only (Scotland, Spain)
   - Detailed sub-regions (North East Scotland, Galicia)
   - Percentage ranges or exact percentages?

5. **Research Sharing**: Proactive or on-request?
   - Wait for request
   - Offer to share in initial message
   - Automatically attach relevant records

6. **Conversation Archival**: When to conclude?
   - After 30 days of inactivity?
   - After explicit "goodbye" message?
   - Never (keep all conversations active)?

7. **Priority Matching**: Prioritization strategy?
   - Close DNA matches (>100 cM) first?
   - In-tree matches first?
   - Recent logins first?
   - Random order?
