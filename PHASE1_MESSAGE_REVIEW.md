✅ Professional yet friendly
✅ Respectful of recipient's time and choice
✅ Good use of placeholders for personalization
✅ Includes family picture link for engagement
✅ Appropriate geographic context for out-of-tree matches

### Areas for Consideration:
⚠️ Initial messages are quite long - may benefit from A/B testing with shorter variants (already have these)
⚠️ All messages reference "automated mailing" - consider if this is necessary
⚠️ Family picture link is same for all messages - could be personalized

### Recommendations:
1. ✅ APPROVE all core sequences (Initial → Follow-Up → Final Reminder)
2. ✅ APPROVE all variant templates
3. ✅ APPROVE special messages
4. Consider monitoring response rates to validate A/B testing effectiveness
