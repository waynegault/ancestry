# Comprehensive Genealogy System Improvements

## Overview

This document outlines the comprehensive improvements made to the genealogy system, focusing on enhanced sentiment analysis, data extraction, and message generation capabilities for Actions 7, 9, 10, and 11.

## Key Improvements Implemented

### 1. Enhanced AI Prompts (ai_prompts.json)

#### Action 7 Improvements
- **Enhanced Intent Classification**: Expanded from 4 to 6 categories for more nuanced sentiment analysis
  - `ENTHUSIASTIC`: Highly engaged and excited about genealogy
  - `CAUTIOUSLY_INTERESTED`: Interested but reserved or uncertain
  - `UNINTERESTED`: Not interested in genealogy discussion
  - `CONFUSED`: Unclear about genealogy concepts or requests
  - `PRODUCTIVE`: Contains valuable genealogical information
  - `OTHER`: General conversation not related to genealogy

- **Advanced Data Extraction**: Sophisticated genealogical data extraction with structured fields
  - Names with nicknames, maiden names, and suffixes
  - Vital records with certainty indicators
  - Relationships with detailed descriptions
  - Locations with geographic context
  - Occupations with time periods
  - Research opportunities and gaps

#### Action 9 Improvements
- **Enhanced Response Generation**: 4-part structured framework
  1. **Acknowledgment**: Personalized greeting and appreciation
  2. **Analysis**: Detailed analysis of shared information
  3. **Relationship Mapping**: Clear explanation of family connections
  4. **Collaboration**: Specific next steps and research suggestions

### 2. Enhanced Data Models (action9_process_productive.py)

#### New Pydantic Models
```python
class NameData(BaseModel):
    full_name: str
    nicknames: List[str] = []
    maiden_name: Optional[str] = None
    generational_suffix: Optional[str] = None

class VitalRecord(BaseModel):
    person: str
    event_type: str  # birth, death, marriage, etc.
    date: Optional[str] = None
    place: Optional[str] = None
    certainty: str = "unknown"  # certain, probable, possible, unknown

class Relationship(BaseModel):
    person1: str
    person2: str
    relationship_type: str
    description: Optional[str] = None

class Location(BaseModel):
    name: str
    geographic_level: str  # country, state, county, city, etc.
    time_period: Optional[str] = None

class Occupation(BaseModel):
    person: str
    job_title: str
    time_period: Optional[str] = None
    location: Optional[str] = None

class ExtractedData(BaseModel):
    # Legacy fields (maintained for backward compatibility)
    mentioned_names: List[str] = []
    mentioned_locations: List[str] = []
    mentioned_dates: List[str] = []
    potential_relationships: List[str] = []
    key_facts: List[str] = []
    
    # Enhanced structured fields
    structured_names: List[NameData] = []
    vital_records: List[VitalRecord] = []
    relationships: List[Relationship] = []
    locations: List[Location] = []
    occupations: List[Occupation] = []
    research_opportunities: List[str] = []
```

### 3. Updated Intent Categories (ai_interface.py)

Updated `EXPECTED_INTENT_CATEGORIES` to include all new sentiment classifications:
```python
EXPECTED_INTENT_CATEGORIES = {
    "ENTHUSIASTIC", 
    "CAUTIOUSLY_INTERESTED", 
    "UNINTERESTED", 
    "CONFUSED", 
    "PRODUCTIVE", 
    "OTHER"
}
```

### 4. Improved Action 7 Processing (action7_inbox.py)

- **Enhanced Status Updates**: Better handling of PRODUCTIVE messages
- **Refined Logic**: Updated person status management based on new intent categories
- **Improved Flow**: PRODUCTIVE messages are kept active for Action 9 processing

### 5. Enhanced Tree Search (action9_process_productive.py)

- **ExtractedData Integration**: Updated `_search_ancestry_tree` to accept ExtractedData objects
- **Backward Compatibility**: Maintains support for legacy list-based name searches
- **Enhanced Name Extraction**: Uses `get_all_names()` method for comprehensive name gathering

## Usage Examples

### 1. Enhanced Intent Classification

```python
from ai_interface import classify_message_intent

# The system now recognizes more nuanced sentiments
context = "I'm really excited to learn about our family history!"
intent = classify_message_intent(context, session_manager)
# Returns: "ENTHUSIASTIC"

context = "I'm not sure I understand what you're asking about..."
intent = classify_message_intent(context, session_manager)
# Returns: "CONFUSED"
```

### 2. Enhanced Data Extraction

```python
from action9_process_productive import ExtractedData, NameData, VitalRecord

# Create structured genealogical data
extracted_data = ExtractedData(
    mentioned_names=["John Smith", "Mary MacDonald"],
    structured_names=[
        NameData(
            full_name="John Smith",
            nicknames=["Johnny"],
            generational_suffix="Jr."
        )
    ],
    vital_records=[
        VitalRecord(
            person="John Smith",
            event_type="birth",
            date="1850-03-15",
            place="Aberdeen, Scotland",
            certainty="probable"
        )
    ]
)

# Get all names for tree searching
all_names = extracted_data.get_all_names()
```

### 3. Enhanced Tree Search

```python
from action9_process_productive import _search_ancestry_tree

# Search using ExtractedData object
results = _search_ancestry_tree(session_manager, extracted_data)

# Or use legacy list format (still supported)
results = _search_ancestry_tree(session_manager, ["John Smith", "Mary Jones"])
```

## Testing and Validation
