# Ancestry Automation Project Environment Variables Example
# ---------------------------------------------------
# This file serves as a template for setting up your environment variables.
# Copy this file to '.env' and fill in your credentials.
#
# IMPORTANT: Security Dependencies
# -------------------------------
# This project uses secure credential storage which requires the following dependencies:
#
# Required packages:
# - cryptography: For secure encryption/decryption of credentials
# - keyring: For secure storage of master encryption keys
#
# Installation:
#   pip install cryptography keyring
#   - OR -
#   pip install -r requirements.txt
#
# Platform-specific notes:
# - Windows: No additional steps needed
# - Linux/macOS: You may need to install an alternative keyring backend:
#   pip install keyrings.alt
#   Some Linux distributions may require additional system packages:
#   For Ubuntu/Debian: sudo apt-get install python3-dbus
#
# Secure Credential Management:
# ----------------------------
# Instead of using this .env file directly, we recommend using the credential manager:
#   python credentials.py
#
# The credential manager will securely encrypt and store your credentials,
# eliminating the need to keep plain-text credentials in your .env file.
#
# Environment Variables
# --------------------
# Only fill these out if you're not using the credential manager:

# Ancestry.com credentials
ANCESTRY_USERNAME=your_username_or_email
ANCESTRY_PASSWORD=your_password

# AI API Keys (optional)
DEEPSEEK_API_KEY=your_deepseek_api_key
GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_google_api_key

# Configuration Options
# --------------------
# Uncomment and modify these as needed:

# LOG_LEVEL=INFO
# HEADLESS=False
# DEBUG=False
# CACHE_DIR=./Cache
