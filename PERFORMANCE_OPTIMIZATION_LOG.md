# Performance Optimization Log

## Phase 1: Aggressive Optimizations (2025-01-17)

### Settings Applied:
- MAX_CONCURRENCY: 2 → 4
- THREAD_POOL_WORKERS: 2 → 4  
- BATCH_SIZE: 5 → 10
- TOKEN_BUCKET_FILL_RATE: 2.0 → 3.0

### Results:
- ✅ **Success**: Pages 272-320 (48 pages processed)
- ✅ **45% improvement** over baseline (48 vs 33 pages)
- ✅ **Performance gains**: 15-20% faster on fast skip pages
- ✅ **Adaptive batching**: Increased to 15 matches per batch
- ❌ **Failure**: Session death cascade at page 320
- ❌ **Root cause**: Session refresh failed due to missing cookies

### Key Insights:
- Phase 1 optimizations worked for 48 pages (significant improvement)
- Higher concurrency eventually overwhelmed session management
- Session refresh mechanism needs improvement
- Cookie management issue during proactive refresh

## Conservative Rollback: Balanced Performance (2025-01-17)

### Settings Applied:
- MAX_CONCURRENCY: 4 → 3 (moderate reduction)
- THREAD_POOL_WORKERS: 4 → 3 (moderate reduction)
- BATCH_SIZE: 10 → 8 (moderate reduction)  
- TOKEN_BUCKET_FILL_RATE: 3.0 → 2.5 (moderate reduction)

### Target Goals:
- Maintain 30-40% performance improvement
- Prevent session death cascade
- Achieve stable long-term processing
- Balance speed with reliability

### Expected Results:
- **Processing capacity**: 40-45 pages (vs 33 baseline)
- **API-heavy pages**: 35-45 seconds (vs 78s baseline)
- **Fast skip pages**: 4-5 seconds (vs 6s baseline)
- **Session stability**: Improved with moderate load

## Lessons Learned:
1. **Gradual optimization** is safer than aggressive changes
2. **Session management** is the critical bottleneck
3. **Cookie handling** during refresh needs improvement
4. **45% improvement is achievable** with proper tuning
5. **Monitor session health** more closely during optimization

## Next Steps:
1. Test conservative rollback settings
2. Monitor for session stability over 50+ pages
3. If stable, consider gradual increases
4. Improve session refresh mechanism
5. Enhance cookie management during refresh
