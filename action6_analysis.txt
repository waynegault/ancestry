# Action 6 Analysis - 2025-11-05 00:22

## Summary
Action 6 completed successfully with 20 matches processed and 0 errors.
However, there are performance concerns and one request tracking issue.

## Issues Found:

### 1. Session Expiration (303 Redirect) - HANDLED CORRECTLY ✅
- Initial API call received 303 See Other (session expired)
- System automatically:
  * Cleared session caches
  * Refreshed session
  * Obtained fresh CSRF token
  * Retried successfully
- **Status**: Working as designed, no fix needed

### 2. Performance Warnings ⚠️
- Batch processing: 73.6s (expected ~30-40s)
- Slow API calls:
  * combined_details: 6-7 seconds (expected 3-5s)
  * relationship_prob: 3-4 seconds (acceptable range)
- **Likely cause**: Ancestry API server slowness
- **Status**: External dependency, no code fix possible

### 3. Request Tracking Discrepancy 🔍
- Total Requests: 53
- Successful Requests: 52
- Failed Requests: 0
- **Issue**: 1 request not counted as successful (likely the 303 redirect)
- **Impact**: Minor - doesn't affect functionality, just metrics
- **Fix**: Update request counter to properly track 303 redirects

## Recommendations:
1. Monitor Ancestry API response times (external issue)
2. Fix request counter to include successful 303 redirects as 'successful'
3. No urgent fixes needed - system working correctly
