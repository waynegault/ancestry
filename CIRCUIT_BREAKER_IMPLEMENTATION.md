# Circuit Breaker Pattern Implementation

## Overview
Implemented the Circuit Breaker pattern to prevent cascading failures from 429 (Too Many Requests) errors across all API-using actions in the Ancestry automation application.

## What is a Circuit Breaker?

The Circuit Breaker pattern is a design pattern used to detect failures and prevent cascading failures in distributed systems. It works like an electrical circuit breaker:

- **CLOSED**: Normal operation, requests pass through
- **OPEN**: Too many failures detected, requests are blocked to prevent further damage
- **HALF_OPEN**: Testing if the service has recovered, allowing limited test requests

---

## Implementation Details

### CircuitBreaker Class

**Location:** `utils.py` (lines 830-998)

**Key Features:**
- Thread-safe state management with `threading.Lock()`
- Configurable failure threshold, recovery timeout, and test request limits
- Automatic state transitions based on success/failure patterns
- Comprehensive metrics tracking

**Configuration:**
```python
CircuitBreaker(
    failure_threshold=5,        # Open circuit after 5 consecutive 429 errors
    recovery_timeout=60.0,      # Wait 60 seconds before testing recovery
    half_open_max_requests=3,   # Allow 3 test requests in HALF_OPEN state
)
```

### Integration with RateLimiter

The CircuitBreaker is integrated directly into the RateLimiter class, making it available to all actions that use the rate limiter:

**Initialization:**
```python
class RateLimiter:
    def __init__(self, ...):
        # ... existing code ...
        
        # Circuit breaker for 429 error protection
        self.circuit_breaker = CircuitBreaker(
            failure_threshold=5,
            recovery_timeout=60.0,
            half_open_max_requests=3,
        )
```

**Failure Recording:**
```python
def increase_delay(self) -> None:
    """Called when 429 error occurs."""
    # Record 429 error in circuit breaker
    self.circuit_breaker.record_failure()
    
    # ... existing delay increase logic ...
    logger.info(f"Rate limit feedback received. Increased base delay from {previous_delay:.2f}s to {self.current_delay:.2f}s (Circuit: {self.circuit_breaker.get_state()})")
```

**Success Recording:**
```python
def decrease_delay(self) -> None:
    """Called on successful request."""
    # Record success in circuit breaker
    self.circuit_breaker.record_success()
    
    # ... existing delay decrease logic ...
```

**Circuit Check:**
```python
def check_circuit_breaker(self) -> bool:
    """
    Check if circuit breaker allows requests.
    
    Returns:
        True if circuit is CLOSED (requests allowed)
        False if circuit is OPEN (requests blocked)
    """
    state = self.circuit_breaker.get_state()
    if state == "OPEN":
        logger.warning(f"üî¥ Circuit breaker is OPEN - blocking API requests to prevent cascading failures")
        return False
    elif state == "HALF_OPEN":
        logger.info(f"üü° Circuit breaker is HALF_OPEN - allowing limited test requests")
    return True
```

---

## State Transitions

### CLOSED ‚Üí OPEN
**Trigger:** Consecutive failures reach threshold (default: 5)

**Behavior:**
- All requests are blocked
- Error message logged: "üî¥ Circuit breaker OPENED after 5 failures - blocking requests for 60s"
- Metrics: `circuit_opens` incremented

**Example:**
```
Request 1: 429 error ‚Üí failure_count = 1 (CLOSED)
Request 2: 429 error ‚Üí failure_count = 2 (CLOSED)
Request 3: 429 error ‚Üí failure_count = 3 (CLOSED)
Request 4: 429 error ‚Üí failure_count = 4 (CLOSED)
Request 5: 429 error ‚Üí failure_count = 5 (OPEN) ‚Üê Circuit opens
Request 6: BLOCKED (circuit is OPEN)
```

### OPEN ‚Üí HALF_OPEN
**Trigger:** Recovery timeout expires (default: 60 seconds)

**Behavior:**
- Limited test requests allowed (default: 3)
- Info message logged: "üü° Circuit breaker HALF_OPEN - testing recovery with 3 requests"
- Metrics: State transition tracked

**Example:**
```
Time 0s:  Circuit OPEN (after 5 failures)
Time 60s: Circuit transitions to HALF_OPEN
Request 1: Allowed (test request 1/3)
Request 2: Allowed (test request 2/3)
Request 3: Allowed (test request 3/3)
Request 4: BLOCKED (max test requests reached)
```

### HALF_OPEN ‚Üí CLOSED
**Trigger:** All test requests succeed (default: 3 successes)

**Behavior:**
- Normal operation resumed
- Success message logged: "üü¢ Circuit breaker CLOSED - normal operation resumed"
- Metrics: `circuit_closes` incremented, `half_open_successes` tracked

**Example:**
```
Circuit: HALF_OPEN
Request 1: Success ‚Üí success_count = 1
Request 2: Success ‚Üí success_count = 2
Request 3: Success ‚Üí success_count = 3 (CLOSED) ‚Üê Circuit closes
Request 4: Normal operation (CLOSED)
```

### HALF_OPEN ‚Üí OPEN
**Trigger:** Any test request fails

**Behavior:**
- Circuit reopens immediately
- Warning message logged: "üî¥ Circuit breaker OPENED after 1 failures - blocking requests for 60s"
- Metrics: `circuit_opens` incremented, `half_open_failures` tracked

**Example:**
```
Circuit: HALF_OPEN
Request 1: Success ‚Üí success_count = 1
Request 2: 429 error ‚Üí Circuit reopens (OPEN)
Request 3: BLOCKED (circuit is OPEN)
```

---

## Metrics Tracking

The circuit breaker tracks comprehensive metrics:

```python
{
    'total_requests': 0,           # Total requests through circuit breaker
    'blocked_requests': 0,         # Requests blocked when circuit is OPEN
    'circuit_opens': 0,            # Number of times circuit opened
    'circuit_closes': 0,           # Number of times circuit closed
    'half_open_successes': 0,      # Successful test requests in HALF_OPEN
    'half_open_failures': 0,       # Failed test requests in HALF_OPEN
}
```

### Metrics Display

Circuit breaker metrics are included in the rate limiter summary:

```
================================================================================
RATE LIMITER METRICS SUMMARY
================================================================================
Total Requests:        549
Successful Requests:   541
Failed Requests:       8
429 Errors:            8

... (rate limiter metrics) ...

CIRCUIT BREAKER METRICS
Current State:         CLOSED
Total Requests:        549
Blocked Requests:      0
Circuit Opens:         0
Circuit Closes:        0
Half-Open Successes:   0
Half-Open Failures:    0
```

## Benefits for All Actions

### Actions That Benefit
All actions that make API calls through the SessionManager's rate limiter:

1. **Action 6** (DNA Match Gathering) - Primary beneficiary
2. **Action 7** (Inbox Processing) - API calls for message retrieval
3. **Action 8** (Messaging) - API calls for sending messages
4. **Action 9** (Productive Match Processing) - API calls for match details
5. **Action 10** (GEDCOM Analysis) - API calls for relationship data
6. **Action 11** (API Research) - API calls for search and family analysis

### Automatic Protection

No code changes required in individual actions - the circuit breaker is automatically active for all API calls that use the rate limiter:

```python
# In any action:
session_manager.rate_limiter.wait()  # Circuit breaker is checked automatically
response = session_manager.api_manager.make_request(...)

# If 429 error occurs:
session_manager.rate_limiter.increase_delay()  # Circuit breaker records failure

# If request succeeds:
session_manager.rate_limiter.decrease_delay()  # Circuit breaker records success
```

## Testing

### Test Coverage

**Test Function:** `test_circuit_breaker()` in `utils.py`

**Tests:**
1. ‚úÖ Circuit breaker instantiation
2. ‚úÖ Initial state is CLOSED
3. ‚úÖ Failure recording and circuit opening (3 failures ‚Üí OPEN)
4. ‚úÖ Request blocking when circuit is OPEN
5. ‚úÖ Transition to HALF_OPEN after recovery timeout
6. ‚úÖ Success recording and circuit closing (2 successes ‚Üí CLOSED)
7. ‚úÖ Metrics tracking (opens, closes, successes, failures)

**Integration Test:** `test_rate_limiter()` updated to verify circuit breaker integration

**Test Results:**
```
‚úÖ PASSED | Duration: 2.16s | 6 tests | Quality: 89.2/100
```

## Usage Examples

### Example 1: Normal Operation (No Failures)

```
Request 1: Success ‚Üí Circuit: CLOSED
Request 2: Success ‚Üí Circuit: CLOSED
Request 3: Success ‚Üí Circuit: CLOSED
... (all requests succeed, circuit stays CLOSED)
```

### Example 2: Temporary Failures (Below Threshold)

```
Request 1: Success ‚Üí Circuit: CLOSED
Request 2: 429 error ‚Üí Circuit: CLOSED (failure_count = 1)
Request 3: Success ‚Üí Circuit: CLOSED (failure_count reset to 0)
Request 4: 429 error ‚Üí Circuit: CLOSED (failure_count = 1)
Request 5: Success ‚Üí Circuit: CLOSED (failure_count reset to 0)
... (circuit stays CLOSED, failures are isolated)
```

### Example 3: Cascading Failures (Circuit Opens)

```
Request 1: 429 error ‚Üí Circuit: CLOSED (failure_count = 1)
Request 2: 429 error ‚Üí Circuit: CLOSED (failure_count = 2)
Request 3: 429 error ‚Üí Circuit: CLOSED (failure_count = 3)
Request 4: 429 error ‚Üí Circuit: CLOSED (failure_count = 4)
Request 5: 429 error ‚Üí Circuit: OPEN (failure_count = 5)
üî¥ Circuit breaker OPENED - blocking requests for 60s

Request 6: BLOCKED
Request 7: BLOCKED
... (60 seconds pass) ...

Request 8: Allowed (HALF_OPEN, test request 1/3)
Request 9: Allowed (HALF_OPEN, test request 2/3)
Request 10: Allowed (HALF_OPEN, test request 3/3)
All succeed ‚Üí Circuit: CLOSED
üü¢ Circuit breaker CLOSED - normal operation resumed
```

## Configuration Recommendations

### Conservative (Default)
```python
failure_threshold=5,        # Open after 5 consecutive failures
recovery_timeout=60.0,      # Wait 60 seconds before testing
half_open_max_requests=3,   # Allow 3 test requests
```

**Best for:** Production environments, high-value operations

### Aggressive
```python
failure_threshold=3,        # Open after 3 consecutive failures
recovery_timeout=30.0,      # Wait 30 seconds before testing
half_open_max_requests=2,   # Allow 2 test requests
```

**Best for:** Development, testing, when API is unstable

### Lenient
```python
failure_threshold=10,       # Open after 10 consecutive failures
recovery_timeout=120.0,     # Wait 120 seconds before testing
half_open_max_requests=5,   # Allow 5 test requests
```

**Best for:** Stable APIs, when occasional failures are acceptable
