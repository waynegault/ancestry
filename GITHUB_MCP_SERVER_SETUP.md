To enable additional toolsets, you would need to add query parameters to the URL or use environment variables (for local server setup).

## Testing the Server

To test that the server is working correctly, you can:

1. **Restart your MCP host application** (VS Code, Claude Desktop, etc.) to load the new configuration
2. **Try a simple command** like asking to "get my GitHub profile" or "search for repositories about Python"
3. **Verify authentication** by checking if the server can access your GitHub data

## Security Notes

- Your GitHub Personal Access Token is stored in the configuration file
- Keep this file secure and do not commit it to version control
- The token has the permissions you granted when creating it
- You can revoke the token at any time from GitHub settings

## Troubleshooting

If the server doesn't work:
1. Verify your GitHub PAT is valid and not expired
2. Check that your MCP host supports remote HTTP servers
3. Ensure you have the necessary permissions on your GitHub account
4. Restart your MCP host application after configuration changes

## Next Steps

You can now use natural language to interact with GitHub through your MCP host. Try commands like:
- "Show me my GitHub profile"
- "Search for Python repositories with more than 1000 stars"
- "List issues in the [owner]/[repo] repository"
- "Create a new issue in [owner]/[repo]"

The server will automatically use the appropriate tools to fulfill your requests!
