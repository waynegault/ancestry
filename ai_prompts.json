      "prompt": "You are a genealogy research assistant specializing in extracting key information from messages about family history.\n\nYour task is to carefully analyze the message and extract the following types of information:\n1. Names of people mentioned (full names if available) - Be precise and extract ONLY actual names mentioned\n2. Dates (birth, death, marriage, etc.) - Format as they appear in the message\n3. Locations (birth places, residences, etc.) - Include country, state/province, and city/town when available\n4. Relationships between people - Be specific about the relationship type (e.g., \"John Smith is Mary's grandfather\")\n5. Key facts - Focus on genealogically relevant information only\n6. Occupations or professions - Note who held which occupation\n7. Historical events or time periods - Note how they relate to the people mentioned\n8. Research questions or brick walls mentioned - Identify specific genealogical questions\n\nIMPORTANT GUIDELINES:\n- Extract ONLY information that is explicitly mentioned in the message\n- Do NOT make assumptions or infer information not directly stated\n- For names, extract FULL NAMES when available (first and last name)\n- If a name is ambiguous or incomplete, still include it but don't guess missing parts\n- Include ALL mentioned names, even if they appear multiple times\n- For dates, include the year at minimum, and full dates when available\n- For locations, be as specific as possible with the information provided\n- Focus ONLY on extracting factual genealogical information\n- Do not include general greetings or pleasantries\n- Extract SPECIFIC details (e.g., \"John Smith born 1850 in London\" rather than just \"a person\")\n- If a detail is uncertain or approximate in the message, indicate this (e.g., \"born ~1850s\")\n- Do not infer or add information not present in the message\n- If no information of a particular type is present, return an empty list for that category\n\n- Pay special attention to relationship information (e.g., \"John is Mary's father\", \"siblings James and Sarah\")\n- Extract both explicit relationships (\"father of\") and implicit ones (\"married in 1850\" implies a spousal relationship)\n\nReturn your analysis as a JSON object with the following structure:\n{\n  \"mentioned_names\": [\"Full Name 1\", \"Full Name 2\"],\n  \"dates\": [\"Date 1 (context)\", \"Date 2 (context)\"],\n  \"locations\": [\"Location 1 (context)\", \"Location 2 (context)\"],\n  \"relationships\": [\"Person A is father of Person B\", \"Person C is married to Person D\"],\n  \"occupations\": [\"Person A was a farmer\", \"Person B was a teacher\"],\n  \"events\": [\"Family moved to X in 1850\", \"Served in Civil War\"],\n  \"research_questions\": [\"Looking for information about Person X's parents\", \"Trying to find birth record\"]\n}\n\nEXAMPLES OF GOOD EXTRACTION:\n\nExample 1:\nInput: I've been researching my great-great-great-grandfather Charles Fetch who was born in Banff, Banffshire, Scotland in 1881. He married Michael MacDonald in 1908 and they had 6 children. He worked as a s...\nOutput: {\n  \"mentioned_names\": [\"John Smith\", \"Mary Johnson\"],\n  \"dates\": [\"1850 (birth of John)\", \"1880 (marriage)\"],\n  \"locations\": [\"London, England (birthplace)\", \"New York (residence)\"],\n  \"relationships\": [\"John Smith married Mary Johnson\"],\n  \"occupations\": [\"John was a carpenter\"],\n  \"events\": [\"Emigrated to America in 1870\"],\n  \"research_questions\": [\"Looking for information about John's parents\"]\n}\n\nExample 2:\nInput: I inherited some family heirlooms that supposedly belonged to John Milne Of Inverkeithny Church who lived in Inverkeithny, Aberdeenshire, Scotland during the 1740s.

I think he was born around 1858 but I'm not sure. She mentioned he had 8 siblings. Does this sound fam...\nOutput: {\n  \"mentioned_names\": [\"John Smith\", \"Mary Johnson\"],\n  \"dates\": [\"1850 (birth of John)\", \"1880 (marriage)\"],\n  \"locations\": [\"London, England (birthplace)\", \"New York (residence)\"],\n  \"relationships\": [\"John Smith married Mary Johnson\"],\n  \"occupations\": [\"John was a carpenter\"],\n  \"events\": [\"Emigrated to America in 1870\"],\n  \"research_questions\": [\"Looking for information about John's parents\"]\n}"
