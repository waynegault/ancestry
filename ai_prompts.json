      "prompt_version": "1.2.0",
      "prompt": "Purpose: classify the last USER message in a genealogy chat by actionability and intent.\n\nContext: history alternates: SCRIPT (me) vs USER (match). Consider the whole history, but judge only the last USER message.\n\nContext usage:\n- Use earlier messages ONLY to interpret references in the last USER message (e.g., \"that record\", \"the link\").\n- Do NOT award PRODUCTIVE based on earlier research detail if the last USER message itself contains no new information, question, or commitment.\n\nRules:\n1) Output exactly one label: ENTHUSIASTIC, CAUTIOUSLY_INTERESTED, UNINTERESTED, CONFUSED, PRODUCTIVE, OTHER\n2) Prioritize actionability over tone:\n   - PRODUCTIVE: The last USER message meaningfully advances research: provides genealogical facts (names, dates, places, relationships, IDs), asks research questions, agrees to share specific information, commits to next steps, requests concrete follow-ups, or shares tree links/records.\n   - ENTHUSIASTIC: Positive tone or rapport-building without clear research content or commitment.\n   - CAUTIOUSLY_INTERESTED: Shows interest with hedging/conditions; requests time; mild engagement without concrete info/commitment yet.\n   - UNINTERESTED: Lack of interest or a clear boundary to stop engaging.\n   - CONFUSED: Confusion about Ancestry/genealogy or how to proceed; requests help understanding basics.\n   - OTHER: Anything not above, including administrative notes (e.g., about copying photos), generic acknowledgements (\"thanks\", \"ok\"), or off-topic content.\n3) Only evaluate the LAST USER message. Use earlier messages only as context.\n4) Courtesy override: If the last USER message is purely greeting/thanks/acknowledgement with no actionable content, classify ENTHUSIASTIC or OTHER, even if earlier messages were productive.\n5) Edge rules:\n   - Do NOT mark PRODUCTIVE for greetings, thanks, or pleasantries alone.\n   - \"No one recognized the photo\" → OTHER (informational, not actionable).\n   - \"Please don't change the source attribution\" → OTHER (administrative).\n   - \"I can share my tree/records this weekend\" → PRODUCTIVE (commitment).\n   - \"I'm not really into genealogy, sorry\" → UNINTERESTED.\n   - \"How do I find our common ancestor?\" → PRODUCTIVE (research question).\n   - \"I'm new to Ancestry; what do I do?\" → CONFUSED.\n   - \"I'm interested, but busy; try me next month\" → CAUTIOUSLY_INTERESTED.\n\nReturn exactly one label, uppercase, with no extra text.\n\nClassification target:\n- LAST USER message only.\n\nAllowed labels:\n- ENTHUSIASTIC | CAUTIOUSLY_INTERESTED | UNINTERESTED | CONFUSED | PRODUCTIVE | OTHER"

I found him in my tree - what an exciting connection! James Gault (1885-1962) is my 2nd great-grandfather through my maternal line. He was born in Banff, Banffshire, Scotland and married Margaret Milne in 1910. They had six children, including my great-grandmother Helen Gault (1915-1998). This means we're 3rd cousins! ...\"\n\nScenario 2 - Person Not Found:\n\"I searched my tree for John MacDonald (b. ~1820 Aberdeen) but haven't found him yet. However, I do have several MacDonald ancestors from Aberdeen in that time period: William MacDonald (1815-1890) and his brother Alexander MacDonald (1818-1895), both fishermen. Would any of these connect to your line? ...\"\n\nScenario 3 - Multiple People:\n\"Wonderful details about your family! I found both people you mentioned:\n\nCharles Fetch (1881-1948) is in my tree as my 3rd great-grandfather. He married Mary MacDonald in 1908 in Banff, and they had six children. He worked as a fisherman his entire life.\n\nMary MacDonald (1885-1965) was Charles's wife and my 3rd great-grandmother. Interestingly, her father was William MacDonald (1850-1920), also a fisherman in Banff. This suggests a strong fishing community connection. ...\"\n\nOUTPUT:\nProduce ONLY the response text (no JSON, no metadata). Be specific, accurate, and engaging."
