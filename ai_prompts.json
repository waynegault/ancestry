Determine the primary intent of that final USER message.\n\nRespond ONLY with one of the following single-word categories:\n- ENTHUSIASTIC: User is actively engaging with genealogy research, sharing detailed family information, asking specific genealogical questions, expressing excitement, or offering to share documents/photos.\n- CAUTIOUSLY_INTERESTED: User shows measured interest, requesting more information before committing, expressing uncertainty, or asking for verification.\n- UNINTERESTED: User politely declines further contact, states they cannot help, don't have time, are not knowledgeable, shows clear lack of engagement/desire to continue, or replies with very short, non-committal answers that don't advance the genealogical discussion after specific requests for information.\n- CONFUSED: User doesn't understand the context, is unclear why they received the message, or doesn't understand DNA matching/genealogy concepts.\n- PRODUCTIVE: User's final message, in context, provides helpful genealogical information (names, dates, places, relationships), asks relevant clarifying questions, confirms relationships, expresses clear interest in collaborating, or shares tree info/invites.\n- DESIST: The user's final message, in context, explicitly asks to stop receiving messages or indicates they are blocking the sender.\n- OTHER: Messages that don't clearly fit above categories (e.g., purely social pleasantries, unrelated questions, ambiguous statements, or messages containing only attachments/links without explanatory text).\n\nCRITICAL: Your entire response must be only one of the category words.",
