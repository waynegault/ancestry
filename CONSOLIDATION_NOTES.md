This file is temporary and summarizes which Markdown sources were consolidated into readme.md during the August 2025 consolidation.

Sources consolidated:
- readme-user.md (User Guide content merged into sections: Purpose, Key Capabilities, Main Menu Options, Success Metrics, Support & Learning)
- readme-technical.md (Developer Details merged into: Architecture, AI Integration, Messaging, Research Task Generation, Performance & Adaptation, Database & Persistence, Testing Strategy, Linting & Code Hygiene, Implementation Phases)
- IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md (Summarized under Implementation Phases (Summary))
- ACTION6_RELIABILITY_REDESIGN_PLAN.md (Key redesign goals and testing approach reflected across Reliability/Phases sections)
- PHASE1/2/3/4 summaries (Rolled into Implementation Phases and Concurrency Evaluation notes)
- EMBEDDED_TESTING_IMPLEMENTATION.md (Embedded Testing Policy)
- AI_PROMPT_CHANGELOG.md (Not duplicated; referenced via Change Log (Prompts) note)

Next step: Once the team confirms the single-README structure, remove the above markdown files, keeping only readme.md.
