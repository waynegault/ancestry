### 1.1 Conversation State Machine Hardening
- [x] Verify state transitions per `reply_management.md` spec ✅ IMPLEMENTED (transition_status method)
- [x] Add `automation_enabled` column to Person table (person-level toggle) ✅ IMPLEMENTED
- [x] Ensure Action 8 respects `automation_enabled` + `conversation_state.status` ✅ IMPLEMENTED
- [x] Add state transition logging for auditability ✅ IMPLEMENTED (transition_status with reason/triggered_by)

### 1.2 Review Queue Integration
- [x] Wire DraftReply queue to Action 7 inbound processing ✅ IMPLEMENTED (InboundOrchestrator)
- [x] Implement idempotent draft creation (update existing pending draft per person/conversation) ✅ IMPLEMENTED (_find_existing_pending + _update_existing_pending)
- [ ] Add confidence scoring to drafts from ContextBuilder output (DEFERRED: requires AI response format changes)
- [x] Create CLI commands: `list`, `review <id>`, `approve`, `reject`, `edit` ✅ PARTIAL (ApprovalQueueService exists)
- [x] Create Web UI for draft review ✅ IMPLEMENTED (review_server.py on localhost:5000)

### 1.3 Send Loop Completion
- [x] Action 11: Mark DraftReply as SENT after successful send ✅ IMPLEMENTED
- [x] Update ConversationState.status after send (ACTIVE → AwaitingReply) ✅ IMPLEMENTED (see 1.6.4)
- [x] Log engagement event for analytics ✅ IMPLEMENTED (_record_engagement_event in action11)

### 1.4 Opt-Out Enforcement
- [x] On DESIST detection: set Person.automation_enabled=False, ConversationState.status=OPT_OUT ✅ IMPLEMENTED
- [x] Block all future outbound for OPT_OUT persons ✅ IMPLEMENTED
- [x] Add opt-out acknowledgment message generation (one final polite closure) ✅ IMPLEMENTED (generate_opt_out_acknowledgment in opt_out_detection.py)

---

## Phase 1.5: Draft Quality Guards (Priority: CRITICAL)

**Goal:** Prevent AI from generating obviously incorrect or inappropriate drafts

### 1.5.1 Self-Messaging Prevention
- [x] Add pre-draft check: block if recipient.profile_id == owner_profile_id ✅ IMPLEMENTED
- [x] Add pre-draft check: block if recipient.uuid == owner_uuid ✅ IMPLEMENTED (via profile_id check)
- [x] Log and alert when self-message attempt detected ✅ IMPLEMENTED
- [x] Add to SafetyGuard as SELF_MESSAGE category ✅ IMPLEMENTED (check_self_message static method)

### 1.5.2 Context Accuracy Validation ✅ IMPLEMENTED
- [x] Pre-draft validation: verify mentioned ancestors exist in OUR tree, not theirs ✅ IMPLEMENTED
- [x] Cross-reference extracted names against TreeQueryService before drafting ✅ IMPLEMENTED
- [x] Flag drafts where AI mentions facts already known to recipient ✅ IMPLEMENTED
- [x] Add AI prompt instruction: "Do not explain relationships the recipient already knows" ✅ IMPLEMENTED
- **Implementation:** Added `ContextAccuracyResult` dataclass and `validate_context_accuracy()` function in ai_interface.py. Uses TreeQueryService to validate extracted names against our GEDCOM tree. Tracks verified_facts (found in tree), unverified_facts (not found), and known_to_recipient (likely already in recipient's tree). Updated `draft_quality_check` prompt v1.1.0 with new quality checks: unverified_fact and known_to_recipient categories. Enhanced `validate_draft_quality()` to run context accuracy validation automatically with optional extracted_names parameter. Added `extract_names_from_text()` helper for heuristic name extraction from drafts. 4 new tests added (18 total in ai_interface.py).

### 1.5.3 AI-Powered Draft Review ✅ IMPLEMENTED
- [x] Create `draft_quality_check` prompt in ai_prompts.json with:
  - Self-reference detection ("Am I the sender?")
  - Context inversion detection ("Is this explaining their own ancestor to them?")
  - Obvious error patterns (wrong relationship direction, deceased person as living)
- [x] Run quality check as post-generation validation before queuing
- [x] Auto-reject drafts that fail quality check with reason logged
- **Implementation:** Added `validate_draft_quality()` function in ai_interface.py with `DraftQualityResult` dataclass. Self-message detection runs first (no AI needed), then AI quality check validates context. Returns structured result with quality_score 0-100, issues_found list, and recommendation.

### 1.5.4 Auto-Correction Pipeline ✅ IMPLEMENTED
- [x] When quality check fails, attempt one AI regeneration with explicit correction
- [x] If regeneration also fails, route to HUMAN_REVIEW with error context
- [x] Track correction success rate for prompt improvement
- **Implementation:** Added `attempt_draft_correction()` function in ai_interface.py with `DraftCorrectionResult` dataclass. Uses `draft_correction` prompt to regenerate drafts with explicit correction guidance. Self-messages are uncorrectable and route directly to HUMAN_REVIEW. Metrics tracked via prompt_telemetry.
- **Integration:** Wired into action8_messaging.py `_generate_contextual_draft_payload()` via `_validate_and_correct_draft()` helper. Runs after draft generation, before queueing. Adds `quality_validated` and `routed_to_human_review` flags to draft payload.

### 1.5.5 Discovered Issues Log (December 2025)
| Issue | Example | Root Cause | Fix Priority |
|-------|---------|------------|--------------|
| Self-message | Draft #3 sent to Wayne | No owner identity check | ✅ FIXED |
| Relationship inversion | Draft #1 explained ancestor already in their tree | AI context confusion | HIGH |

---

- [x] Add rollback on partial failure (e.g., log created but metrics update failed)
- [x] Ensure draft status stays APPROVED if send API fails
- **Implementation:** Core operations wrapped in try/except with `db_session.rollback()` on failure; non-critical operations (engagement event, metrics) isolated with separate error handling

### 1.6.2 Draft Expiration ✅ IMPLEMENTED
- [x] Implement draft expiration logic (expires_at field calculated but unused)
- [x] Add scheduled job to mark PENDING → EXPIRED after 72 hours
- [x] Surface expired drafts in review queue with different styling
- **Implementation:** Added `expires_at` column to DraftReply model; `ApprovalQueueService.queue_for_review()` now stores expiration timestamp; `expire_old_drafts()` enhanced to use expires_at with fallback to created_at for legacy drafts

### 1.6.3 Duplicate Send Prevention ✅ IMPLEMENTED
- [x] Add guard: skip if draft already SENT (prevent re-processing on retry)
- [x] Check for recent OUT log before sending (idempotency window)
- [x] Log duplicate attempt instead of sending again
- **Implementation:** New `_check_duplicate_send()` function checks draft.status=="SENT" and queries ConversationLog for recent OUT messages within 5-minute idempotency window

### 1.6.4 ConversationState Synchronization ✅ IMPLEMENTED
- [x] Update ConversationState.status after successful send (ACTIVE → AwaitingReply)
- [x] Set ConversationState.last_outbound_at timestamp
- [x] Verify state machine transitions per reply_management.md spec
- **Implementation:** Enhanced `_touch_conversation_state_after_send()` to update `conversation_phase="awaiting_reply"`, refresh `updated_at`, respect hard-stop states (OPT_OUT, HUMAN_REVIEW, PAUSED, COMPLETED), with debug logging

- ✅ Sending human-approved drafts (Action 11) - Production ready
- ✅ Shared match collection (Action 12) - Production ready
- ✅ Triangulation analysis (Action 13) - Production ready

**NOT YET SAFE for:**
- ❌ Auto-sending without human review (auto_approve_enabled=True)
- ❌ Fully automated reply loops

### Risk Assessment

| Risk | Severity | Mitigation |
|------|----------|------------|
| Sending inappropriate message | HIGH | Draft-first posture, human approval required |
| Contacting opted-out person | HIGH | SafetyGuard + OptOutDetector block outbound |
| Rate limiting violation | MEDIUM | 0.3 RPS enforced, validated over 800+ pages |
| AI hallucination in reply | MEDIUM | Review queue catches before send |
| Session expiry mid-operation | LOW | Circuit breaker + proactive refresh |

## Appendix: Mission Alignment Matrix

| Mission Requirement | Implementation Status | Gap |
|---------------------|----------------------|-----|
| 1. Acknowledge & respect opt-out | ✅ SafetyGuard + OptOutDetector | Need opt-out acknowledgment message |
| 2. Answer questions from tree | ⚠️ SemanticSearch + TreeQuery scaffolded | Need end-to-end integration |
| 3. Extract & validate facts | ✅ FactValidator + DataConflict | ConflictDetector not wired (Phase 11.2) |
| 4. Suggest research areas | ⚠️ PredictiveGaps (827 lines) available | Not surfaced in drafts (Phase 11.3) |
| 5. 100% automated unless escalation | ⚠️ Safety escalation works | Auto-approval not enabled |
| 6. Performance metrics | ⚠️ ConversationMetrics exists | Dashboard not populated (Phase 9.2) |
| 7. High-quality, personalized messages | ✅ ContextBuilder + MessagePersonalizer (1987 lines) | 30+ functions available but underutilized |
| 8. Extract insights for tree | ⚠️ Fact extraction works | Tree update not implemented (Phase 8) |
| 9. Triangulation intelligence | ✅ TriangulationIntelligence (724 lines) ready | Not called from pipeline (Phase 11.1) |

## Session Notes

### December 14, 2025 - Session 3 (Extended Review)

**Areas Reviewed:**
- AI prompts structure (ai_prompts.json) - 9 versioned prompts
- ContextBuilder (931 lines) - MatchContext assembly
- Research modules (3000+ lines total):
  - triangulation_intelligence.py (724 lines) - hypothesis scoring
  - conflict_detector.py (547 lines) - field comparison
  - predictive_gaps.py (827 lines) - gap detection
- Message personalization (1987 lines) - 30+ personalization functions
- Observability infrastructure (1300+ lines) - Prometheus/Grafana scaffolded
- MS Graph integration (813 lines) - Office 365 To-Do
- CI/CD workflows (3 GitHub Actions)
- Documentation (operator_manual.md exists, 512 lines)

**Key Findings:**
1. **Research modules fully implemented but not integrated** - Added Phase 11
2. **Observability scaffolded but not emitting** - Phase 9 gaps confirmed
3. **Operator manual exists** - Updated todo.md to reflect
4. **CI/CD in place** - tests.yml, quality-gate.yml, lint-typecheck.yml
5. **83 TODO/FIXME comments** remain in codebase
6. **Placeholder code in production** - triangulation_intelligence.py:390, relationship_utils.py stubs

### December 14, 2025 - Session 4 (Deep Dive)

**Additional Areas Reviewed:**
- CLI infrastructure (cli/research_tools.py 1210 lines, cli/maintenance.py 1895 lines)
- UI infrastructure (menu.py 305 lines, terminal_test_agent.py)
- API layer (api_search_core.py 1266 lines - Priority 1 Todo #10 caching)
- Core infrastructure:
  - feature_flags.py (594 lines) - Runtime toggles with rollout percentages
  - pii_redaction.py (523 lines) - Log security filters
  - opt_out_detection.py (599 lines) - Multi-layer safeguards
  - rate_limiter.py (1915 lines) - Unified adaptive rate limiting
  - circuit_breaker.py (793 lines) - Session circuit breaker pattern
  - health_check.py (830 lines) - Startup health checks
- A/B testing (ab_testing.py 612 lines) - Experiment management
- Integration tests (test_integration_e2e.py 292 lines) - E2E flow tests
- Conversation analytics (892 lines) - Engagement tracking

**Key Findings:**
1. **Feature flags underutilized** - Full rollout framework exists but not wired to actions ✅ FIXED: Action 11 uses ACTION11_SEND_ENABLED flag
2. **PII redaction not enabled** - 523 lines of redaction code but not active in production logging ✅ FIXED: Wired to logging_config.py, enabled via PII_REDACTION_ENABLED=true
3. **A/B testing disconnected** - ExperimentManager exists but not connected to prompt selection ✅ FIXED: ai_interface uses get_prompt_with_experiment(); MessagePersonalizer uses ExperimentManager
4. **Conversation analytics not wired** - 892 lines of engagement tracking not called from InboundOrchestrator ✅ FIXED: _update_metrics() already wires EngagementTracking
5. **Health checks menu-only** - Should run on startup, currently only via 'health' menu action ✅ FIXED: lifecycle.py calls run_startup_health_checks()
6. **Empty tests/ directory** - All tests are in testing/ directory or embedded in modules ✅ FIXED: Added tests/README.md explaining embedded pattern
7. **ResearchToolsCLI comprehensive** - Good lazy-loading patterns, full research feature access
