## 🎯 RECOMMENDATIONS FOR FUTURE WORK

### Priority 1: High-Complexity Functions
1. Refactor `get_api_family_details()` (complexity 49)
2. Refactor `_api_req()` (complexity 27)
3. Refactor `search_gedcom_for_criteria()` (complexity 24)
4. Refactor `_validate_and_normalize_date()` (complexity 23)
5. Refactor `cache_gedcom_processed_data()` (complexity 23)

### Priority 2: Type Hints
- Add comprehensive type hints to all functions
- Focus on modules with 0.0 quality scores first
- Use mypy for type checking validation

### Priority 3: Test Function Complexity
- Decide on policy for test functions with complexity >10
- Consider breaking down large test functions (>500 lines)
- Maintain test coverage while improving test quality

### Priority 4: Documentation Consolidation
- Merge multiple markdown files into single readme.md
- Create comprehensive developer guide
- Document coding standards and patterns
