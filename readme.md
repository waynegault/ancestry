### Quick Start

#### From Main Menu:
```bash
python main.py
# Choose option: sec. Credential Manager (Setup/View/Update)
```

#### Direct Access:
```bash
python credentials.py
```

### Available Operations

1. **View stored credentials** - Display all credentials with masked values for security

7. **Export credentials for backup** - Secure backup functionality
8. **Check credential status** - Security health check and validation

### .env File Import Feature

The system now supports importing credentials from `.env` files, making it easy to migrate from other projects or bulk-import credentials.

#### How to Use .env Import:

**1. Create a .env file:**
```bash
# Required credentials
ANCESTRY_USERNAME=your_username@example.com
ANCESTRY_PASSWORD=your_secure_password

# Optional AI API keys
DEEPSEEK_API_KEY=your_deepseek_api_key_here
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
```

**2. Import via credential manager:**
```bash
python credentials.py
# Choose option 6: "Import credentials from .env file"
# Enter file path (or press Enter for default .env)
```

**3. Conflict Resolution:**
If you have existing credentials, choose:
- **Merge**: Keep existing, add new credentials
- **Overwrite**: Replace conflicts with .env values
- **Replace all**: Use only .env credentials
- **Cancel**: Cancel the import

#### .env File Format Support:
- Basic format: `KEY=VALUE`
- Quoted values: `API_KEY="value with spaces"`
- Comments: `# This is a comment`
- Empty lines are ignored

#### Security Notes:
- .env files contain **unencrypted** credentials - handle securely
- After import, credentials are encrypted using SecurityManager
- Consider deleting .env file after successful import
- Never commit .env files to version control

## Environment Variables and Credentials Guide

### Security Dependencies

The secure credential management system requires the following dependencies:

| Dependency | Purpose | Required |
|------------|---------|----------|
| cryptography | For secure encryption/decryption of credentials | Yes |
| keyring | For secure storage of master encryption keys | Yes |
| keyrings.alt | Alternative keyring backend for Linux/macOS | Recommended for Linux/macOS |

### Installation Instructions

```bash
# Install core dependencies
pip install cryptography keyring

# For Linux/macOS users
pip install keyrings.alt
```

Alternatively, install all dependencies using the requirements.txt file:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Platform-Specific Notes

- **Windows**: No additional configuration needed
- **Linux/macOS**: You may need additional system packages:
  - Ubuntu/Debian: `sudo apt-get install python3-dbus`
  - Fedora: `sudo dnf install python3-dbus`

### Using the Credential Manager (Recommended)

The safest way to manage your credentials is with the credential manager:

```bash
python credentials.py
```

This tool will:
1. Encrypt your credentials with a master key
2. Store the master key securely in your system's keyring
3. Provide an interactive interface for managing credentials

### Using Environment Variables (Alternative)

If you prefer to use environment variables:

1. Copy the `.env.example` file to `.env`
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

2. Edit the `.env` file and add your credentials:
   ```
   ANCESTRY_USERNAME=your_username_or_email
   ANCESTRY_PASSWORD=your_password
   DEEPSEEK_API_KEY=your_deepseek_api_key
   GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_google_api_key
   ```

### Importing Existing Credentials

If you already have credentials in a `.env` file and want to import them into the secure storage:

1. Run the credential manager:
   ```bash
   python credentials.py
   ```

2. Select option 6: "Import credentials from .env file"
3. Follow the prompts to import your credentials

### Troubleshooting

#### Security Dependency Issues

If you encounter issues with security dependencies:

1. **Installation Errors**:
   - For permission errors: `pip install --user cryptography keyring`
   - For build errors with cryptography:
     - Windows: Ensure Visual C++ Build Tools are installed
     - Linux: Install `python3-dev` and `libffi-dev` packages

2. **Keyring Access Issues**:
   - If you're having trouble with the system keyring:
     ```bash
     pip install keyrings.alt
     ```

3. **ImportError When Running**:
   - If you see "Security dependencies not available":
     ```bash
     pip install cryptography keyring
     ```

config_schema.api.tree_name         # Family tree name
config_schema.api.timeout           # API request timeout
config_schema.api.app_mode          # Application mode setting
```

**Database Configuration (`config_schema.database`)**
```python
config_schema.database.database_file    # SQLite database file
config_schema.database.gedcom_file_path # GEDCOM file location
config_schema.database.data_dir         # Data directory path
config_schema.database.pool_size        # Connection pool size
```

**Selenium Configuration (`config_schema.selenium`)**
```python
config_schema.selenium.headless_mode        # Run browser headless
config_schema.selenium.debug_port           # Chrome debug port
config_schema.selenium.chrome_driver_path   # ChromeDriver location
config_schema.selenium.chrome_user_data_dir # Chrome profile directory
```

**AI Configuration**
```python
config_schema.ai_provider              # AI provider (deepseek/google)
config_schema.api.deepseek_api_key     # DeepSeek API key
config_schema.api.google_api_key       # Google Gemini API key
config_schema.user_name                # User name for AI context
config_schema.user_location            # User location for AI context
```

#### **Helper Functions for Legacy Compatibility**

Some modules maintain helper functions that map legacy keys to new schema paths:

```python
def get_config_value(key: str, default=None):
    """Maps legacy keys to new schema paths"""
    key_mapping = {
        "ANCESTRY_USERNAME": lambda: config_schema.api.username,
        "GEDCOM_FILE_PATH": lambda: config_schema.database.gedcom_file_path,
        "TESTING_PROFILE_ID": lambda: config_schema.test.test_profile_id,
        # ... more mappings
    }
    return key_mapping.get(key, lambda: getattr(config_schema, key, default))()
```

### 8.5 Configuration Best Practices

#### **Adding New Configuration**
1. **Extend Schema**: Add new attributes to appropriate dataclass in `config_schema.py`
2. **Add Validation**: Include appropriate validation logic and default values
3. **Update Manager**: Modify `config_manager.py` if new loading logic needed
4. **Test Thoroughly**: Verify new configuration loads correctly
5. **Document Changes**: Update documentation and type hints

#### **Accessing Configuration**
```python
# ‚úÖ Recommended - Direct attribute access
username = config_schema.api.username

# ‚úÖ Good - With error handling
try:
    timeout = config_schema.api.timeout
except AttributeError:
    timeout = 30  # fallback

# ‚ùå Avoid - Legacy patterns (these were removed)
# username = getattr(config_schema, "ANCESTRY_USERNAME", "")
```

#### **Configuration Validation**
```python
# The system automatically validates configuration on load
# Custom validation can be added to schema dataclasses
@dataclass
class APIConfig:
    username: str = field(default="")
    
    def __post_init__(self):
        if not self.username:
            raise ValueError("API username is required")
```
