    Tests [module_purpose].

    Categories: Initialization, Core Functionality, Edge Cases, Integration, Performance, Error Handling
    """
    try:
        from test_framework import TestSuite, suppress_logging
        has_framework = True
    except ImportError:
        has_framework = False
    
    if not has_framework:

            return True
        except Exception as e:
            logger.error(f"❌ Basic [module] tests failed: {e}")
            return False

    with suppress_logging():
        suite = TestSuite("[Module Purpose & Description]", "[module_name].py")
        suite.start_suite()
        
        # === INITIALIZATION TESTS ===
        def test_module_initialization():
            """Test module initialization and dependencies."""
            # Real test implementation
            return True
        
        suite.run_test(
            "Module Initialization",
            test_module_initialization,
            "Expected behavior description",
            "What is being tested",
            "How the test is performed"

```python
def create_mock_data(data_type: str, **kwargs):
    """Create realistic mock data for testing."""
    generators = {
        'dna_match': create_mock_dna_match,
        'message': create_mock_message,  
        'person': create_mock_person,
        'conversation': create_mock_conversation,
        'gedcom_record': create_mock_gedcom_record
    }
    return generators.get(data_type, lambda: {})(**kwargs)
```

**Assertion Helpers**
```python
def assert_valid_function(func: callable, name: str) -> None:
    """Assert that function is callable and properly defined."""
    
def assert_non_empty_dict(data: dict, name: str = "dictionary") -> None:
    """Assert that dictionary is not empty."""
```

#### 8.4.10 **Test Development Guidelines**

**Adding Tests to New Modules**

1. **Follow the standardized pattern** exactly as shown above
2. **Import test framework** with proper fallback handling
3. **Implement meaningful basic tests** for when framework unavailable
4. **Create 6-category test structure** covering all major functionality
5. **Use suppress_logging()** wrapper around test suite
6. **Add comprehensive error handling** for all test scenarios
7. **Document test coverage** and any special testing considerations

**Quality Requirements**
- ✅ No dummy tests or meaningless assertions
- ✅ Real functionality verification with meaningful assertions
- ✅ Proper handling of timeouts (especially for GEDCOM processing)
- ✅ Consistent error handling and graceful degradation
- ✅ Standardized logging suppression to avoid noise
- ✅ Comprehensive coverage across all 6 test categories

**Test Function Best Practices**

- **Descriptive Names**: Use clear, descriptive test function names
- **Comprehensive Coverage**: Test both success and failure scenarios  
- **Isolated Tests**: Each test should be independent and not rely on others
- **Clear Assertions**: Use specific assertions with meaningful error messages
- **Mock External Dependencies**: Use mocks for API calls, file I/O, and database operations
- **Performance Awareness**: Include performance validation for critical operations

**Example New Module Test Implementation**
```python
def test_new_functionality():
    """Test new functionality with comprehensive validation."""
    with suppress_logging():
        try:
            # Arrange: Set up test data
            input_data = create_mock_data('test_input')
            expected_result = {'status': 'success', 'data': []}
            
            # Act: Execute function under test
            actual_result = new_function(input_data)
            
            # Assert: Validate results
            assert actual_result is not None, "Function must return a result"
            assert actual_result['status'] == expected_result['status'], \
                   f"Expected status {expected_result['status']}, got {actual_result['status']}"
            assert isinstance(actual_result['data'], list), \
                   "Data field must be a list"
                   
            return True
            
        except Exception as e:
            print(f"Test failed with error: {e}")
            return False
```

### Directory Structure Overview

```
Ancestry/
├── Root Level (45 Python modules + config files)
├── core/ (7 modular architecture components)
├── config/ (3 configuration management modules)
├── Data/ (databases + GEDCOM files + empty Logs/)
├── Cache/ (1 cache database)
├── .vscode/ (editor settings)
├── .venv/ (virtual environment)
├── .git/ (version control)
└── __pycache__/ directories (regenerable bytecode)
```

### Summary Statistics

- **Total Files**: 65+ individual files
- **Total Directories**: 9 active directories (+ subdirectories)
- **Python Modules**: 45+ `.py` files
- **Configuration Files**: 6 files (`.env`, `.gitignore`, etc.)
- **Database Files**: 3 files (2 SQLite + 1 GEDCOM)
- **Cache Directories**: 4 `__pycache__` directories (regenerable)

### Cleanup History

✅ **Successfully Removed** (5 directories during codebase cleanup):
- `compatibility/` - Legacy support modules (removed - no dependencies found)
- `migration/` - Architectural migration tools (removed - migration completed)
- `.migration/` - Empty directory (removed)
- `.pytest_cache/` - Regenerable test cache (removed)
- `improved_prompts/` - Outdated AI prompts (removed)

### File Organization Principles

The codebase follows a modular architecture pattern:

1. **Root Level**: Core application logic and action modules
2. **`core/`**: Modular architecture components for session, database, and API management
3. **`config/`**: Configuration management and credential handling
4. **`Data/`**: Persistent data storage (databases, GEDCOM files)
5. **`Cache/`**: Performance optimization through caching
6. **Support Directories**: Version control, virtual environment, and editor settings

This organization ensures maintainability, modularity, and clear separation of concerns while supporting the complex requirements of genealogy automation and AI integration.
