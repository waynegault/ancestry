## 6. Appendix A: GEDCOM File Structure and Access

### 6.1 GEDCOM File Overview

GEDCOM (GEnealogical Data COMmunication) is the standard format for exchanging genealogical data between different software applications. The system uses the `ged4py` library to parse and process GEDCOM files.

### 6.2 GEDCOM Structure Elements

#### Individual Records (INDI)
```
0 @I1@ INDI
1 NAME John /Smith/
2 GIVN John
2 SURN Smith
1 SEX M
1 BIRT
2 DATE 15 MAR 1850
2 PLAC London, England
1 DEAT
2 DATE 22 DEC 1920
2 PLAC New York, USA
1 FAMC @F1@
1 FAMS @F2@
```

#### Family Records (FAM)
```
0 @F1@ FAM
1 HUSB @I1@
1 WIFE @I2@
1 CHIL @I3@
1 CHIL @I4@
1 MARR
2 DATE 10 JUN 1875
2 PLAC Boston, Massachusetts
```

### 6.3 System GEDCOM Processing

#### Data Loading (`gedcom_utils.py`)
- **File Parsing**: Uses `GedcomReader` to parse GEDCOM files
- **Individual Extraction**: Processes all INDI records into structured data
- **Relationship Mapping**: Builds family relationship graphs
- **Date Normalization**: Standardizes various date formats
- **Name Processing**: Handles given names, surnames, and variants

#### Caching Strategy (`gedcom_cache.py`)
- **Preprocessed Data**: Caches parsed individuals for instant access
- **Relationship Maps**: Stores parent-child and spouse relationships
- **Search Indexes**: Creates searchable indexes for names, dates, places
- **Performance Optimization**: Reduces GEDCOM processing time by 95%+

#### Scoring Algorithms
The system implements sophisticated scoring for person matching:

**Name Matching**:
- `contains_first_name`: 25 points if input first name contained in candidate
- `contains_surname`: 25 points if input surname contained in candidate
- `bonus_both_names_contain`: 25 additional points if both names match

**Date Matching**:
- `exact_birth_date`: 25 points for exact birth date match
- `exact_death_date`: 25 points for exact death date match
- `year_birth`: 20 points for birth year match
- `year_death`: 20 points for death year match
- `approx_year_birth`: 10 points for birth year within range
- `approx_year_death`: 10 points for death year within range

**Additional Criteria**:
- `gender_match`: 15 points for gender agreement
- `contains_pob`: 25 points for place of birth match
- `contains_pod`: 25 points for place of death match
- `bonus_birth_info`: 25 points if both birth year and place match
- `bonus_death_info`: 25 points if both death year and place match

### 6.4 Relationship Path Calculation

The system uses graph traversal algorithms to calculate relationship paths:

#### Path Finding Algorithm
1. **Build Relationship Graph**: Create nodes for individuals and edges for relationships
2. **Bidirectional Search**: Search from both individuals toward common ancestors
3. **Path Reconstruction**: Build the complete relationship path
4. **Relationship Naming**: Convert path to genealogical relationship terms

#### Relationship Types Supported
- Direct ancestors/descendants (parent, grandparent, great-grandparent)
- Siblings and their descendants (aunt, uncle, cousin)
- Complex relationships (cousin once removed, half-siblings)
- Step and adopted relationships
- Multiple relationship paths (when individuals are related in multiple ways)

### 6.5 GEDCOM File Requirements

#### Supported GEDCOM Versions
- GEDCOM 5.5 (most common)
- GEDCOM 5.5.1
- Limited support for earlier versions

#### File Size Considerations
- **Small Files** (< 1MB): Processed in memory without caching
- **Medium Files** (1-50MB): Cached for performance optimization
- **Large Files** (> 50MB): Requires aggressive caching and may need chunked processing

#### Data Quality Requirements
- **Individual IDs**: Must be unique and properly formatted (@I123@)
- **Family IDs**: Must be unique and properly formatted (@F123@)
- **Date Formats**: Supports multiple formats but prefers standard GEDCOM dates
- **Character Encoding**: UTF-8 preferred, handles most common encodings
