# Project-wide intentional patterns:
# - E402: imports after module setup (setup_module) by design
# - F401: unused imports (re-exports in utils.py and other modules)
# - F403/F405: controlled star imports for CSS selectors/constants
# - B009/B010: setattr/getattr with constants (SQLAlchemy ORM pattern)
# - PLR0913: many arguments in config classes by design
# - PLR0915: many statements in main functions by design
# - PLR2004: magic value comparisons (intentional for readability)
# - PLC0415: imports outside top-level (architectural decision)
# - UP006: non-PEP585 annotations (Python 3.9 compatibility)
# - UP007: Union syntax (Python 3.9 compatibility)
