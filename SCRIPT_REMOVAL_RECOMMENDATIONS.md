3. **api_search_utils.py** (1,252 lines)
   - API search utilities
   - Check: Is it used by action11.py or other actions?

4. **performance_orchestrator.py** (982 lines)
   - Performance orchestration
   - Check: Is it used by main.py menu?

5. **chromedriver.py** (839 lines)

### Medium Priority Investigation (4 scripts)
6. **genealogical_normalization.py** (693 lines)
   - Data normalization utilities
   - Check: Is it used by any action scripts?

7. **performance_dashboard.py** (492 lines)
   - Performance dashboard

9. **universal_scoring.py** (393 lines)
   - Universal scoring for genealogical research
   - **Status:** KEEP - Intended for use by action10.py and action11.py
   - Check: Verify it's imported by action10 and action11

**Total Under Review: 7,826 lines (10.2% of codebase)**

## TIER 3: KEEP - ESSENTIAL PRODUCTION CODE (11 scripts)

Core production scripts that must be retained:

| Script | Lines | Purpose |
|--------|-------|---------|
| utils.py | 4,717 | Core utilities |
| action8_messaging.py | 3,829 | Messaging action |
| database.py | 3,425 | Database layer |
| action11.py | 3,333 | Genealogical research API |
| api_utils.py | 3,328 | API utilities |
| action10.py | 2,554 | DNA match gathering |
| main.py | 2,312 | Entry point |
| action9_process_productive.py | 2,051 | Process productive action |
| action7_inbox.py | 2,142 | Inbox action |
| action6_gather.py | 1,489 | DNA gathering action |
| run_all_tests.py | 1,708 | Test runner |
| test_framework.py | 959 | Test infrastructure |

**Total: 31,947 lines (41.5% of codebase)**

---

## TIER 4: KEEP - UTILITY/SUPPORT MODULES (56 scripts)

Actively used by production code. Includes:
- **standard_imports.py** - Used by 46 scripts
- **test_utilities.py** - Used by 39 scripts
- **config.py** - Used by 25 scripts
- **common_params.py** - Used by 11 scripts
- **cache.py** - Used by 10 scripts
- **logging_config.py** - Used by 10 scripts
- And 50 other utility modules

**Total: 40,000+ lines (52% of codebase)**

## Recommended Action Plan

### Phase 1: Immediate Removal (1-2 hours)
Remove 10 development/diagnostic tools:
```bash
rm performance_validation.py fix_pylance_issues.py add_noqa_comments.py \
   automate_too_many_args.py apply_automated_refactoring.py \
   refactor_test_functions.py test_phase2_improvements.py \
   validate_rate_limiting.py test_rate_limiting.py diagnose_chrome.py
```

**Impact:** Reduces codebase by 2,449 lines with zero production impact

### Phase 2: Investigation (2-4 hours)
For each of the 9 scripts under review:
1. Search for usage in main.py menu
2. Check if used by external scripts
3. Verify if planned for future use
4. Consolidate if duplicate functionality

### Phase 3: Cleanup (1-2 hours)
Remove any scripts identified as dead code in Phase 2

---

## Expected Outcomes

**After Phase 1:**
- Codebase reduced by 2,449 lines (3.2%)
- 67 scripts remaining
- No production impact
- Cleaner development environment

**After Phase 2-3 (if all removed):**
- Codebase reduced by 10,275 lines (13.4%)
- 58 scripts remaining
- Requires verification of Phase 2 scripts

---

## Recommendation

‚úÖ **Proceed with Phase 1 immediately** - These are clearly development tools with no production dependencies

‚ö†Ô∏è **Schedule Phase 2 investigation** - Need to verify usage patterns for the 9 scripts under review

üîç **Keep universal_scoring.py** - It's intended for use by action10 and action11
