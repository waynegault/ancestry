All open work is captured in the single checklist below. Address items in priority order unless a dependency is noted.

- [ ] **Knowledge Graph & README Export** (Est. 1h)
  regenerate the code graph/README snapshots and commit the artifacts so downstream consumers have the latest state.

- [ ] **Maintainer Handoff Brief** (Est. 1h)
  Summarize outcomes, unresolved risks, and recommended sequencing for the next maintainer before project pause/transition.
