# IMPLEMENTATION PLAN - High-Impact Optimization & Modernization

## AUGMENT REVISION ‚Äî 2025-08-08 (Focused, Low‚ÄëRisk Improvement Plan)

Goal: Improve data extraction fidelity, data interrogation quality, message personalization, and MS To‚ÄëDo task specificity with minimal, reversible changes. We will implement in very small phases, validating after each.

Operating Procedure (for every phase):
1) Run baseline tests with run_all_tests.py (no flags) to confirm green
2) Create a git checkpoint commit (exclude Cache/, __pycache__/, WAL/SHM)
3) Implement the phase across the codebase (complete, not partial)
4) Verify completeness (grep/search, targeted checks)
5) Run run_all_tests.py; if many failures, immediately revert to prior checkpoint
6) Update this plan with progress/results
7) Commit the phase with a descriptive message

Phased Recommendations (this revision):
- Phase 1: Extraction Normalization & Schema Guards (Active)
  - Add a normalization layer that converts any partial/legacy keys (e.g., mentioned_* flat fields) to the structured schema used by downstream features (structured_names, vital_records, relationships, locations, occupations, research_questions, documents_mentioned, dna_information)
  - Deduplicate and sanitize string lists; enforce list-of-strings for suggested_tasks
  - Integrate post-parse normalization in action9_process_productive._process_ai_response so both validated and salvaged AI responses converge on the structured shape consumed by messaging and task generation
  - Success criteria: no test regressions; extracted_data always contains the structured keys; downstream message/task generators see richer data when flat inputs occur

- Phase 2: Data Interrogation & QA Metrics (Planning)
  - Lightweight scoring of extracted_data completeness (names/locations/dates present, relationship count, doc mentions)
  - Add simple conflict/consistency checks (e.g., impossible dates, empty place strings) with debug-level logs only
  - Provide a compact summary helper for logging inside action7/8/9 to keep output within header/footer blocks and respect log level

- Phase 3: Message Personalization Coverage & Quality Gates (Planning)
# IMPLEMENTATION PLAN - Focused, Low-Risk Improvements (2025-08-08)

Goal: Improve data extraction fidelity, data interrogation quality, message personalization, and MS To‚ÄëDo task specificity with minimal, reversible changes. Implement in very small phases, validating after each.

Operating Procedure (each phase):
1) Run baseline tests with run_all_tests.py
2) Create a git checkpoint commit (exclude Cache/, __pycache__/, WAL/SHM, DB files)
3) Implement the phase across the codebase (complete, not partial)
4) Verify completeness (search/grep, targeted checks)
5) Re-run tests; if failures spike, revert to prior checkpoint
6) Update this plan with progress/results
7) Commit the phase with a descriptive message

Current Baseline (2025-08-08): 52 modules, 418 tests, all passing.

Phases:
- Phase 1: Extraction Normalization & Schema Guards (Completed)
   - Ensured legacy/flat keys are promoted to structured schema: structured_names, vital_records, relationships, locations, occupations, research_questions, documents_mentioned, dna_information
   - Enforced list-of-strings for suggested_tasks; de-duplicated/sanitized lists
   - Integrated post-parse normalization in action9 _process_ai_response so both validated and salvaged AI responses converge on the structured shape
   - Status: Integrated; tests green (52 modules, 418 tests)

- Phase 2: Data Interrogation & QA Metrics (Active; logging-only, no behavior change)
   - Use extraction_quality.summarize_extracted_data to log counts/flags at debug level in action7/8/9
   - Add minimal consistency checks (e.g., empty strings, implausible dates) as log messages only
   - Deliverables: debug logs; no changes to DB, messages, or task creation

- Phase 3: Message Personalization Coverage & Quality Gates (Planned)
   - Audit templates/placeholders; guarantee safe defaults for all MessagePersonalizer keys
   - Add pre-send ‚Äúpersonalization sanity‚Äù check (log-only in dry_run)

- Phase 4: Task Enrichment & De‚Äëduplication (Planned)
   - Normalize and de‚Äëdup suggested_tasks; enrich titles/bodies with structured context when available
   - Optional idempotency hash per session to avoid near-duplicates (no behavior change in dry_run)

Notes respected:
- Logging honors log level; no user-visible behavior changes until explicitly stated
- Session/cookie handling unchanged; conservative processing limits retained; .env untouched
- Readme consolidation to a single readme.md will be done after phases complete

- **Impact**: Suboptimal AI extraction results, poor data quality
- **Evidence**: Prompt shows simple JSON but code expects complex structured fields
- **Priority**: HIGH - Foundation for all AI-driven features

#### **2. Message Quality & Personalization Gaps**
- **Issue**: Static message templates don't leverage extracted genealogical data
- **Impact**: Generic, impersonal messages with low engagement
- **Evidence**: messages.json templates use basic placeholders, ignore rich extracted data
- **Priority**: HIGH - Direct impact on user experience

#### **3. Task Actionability & Specificity Issues**
- **Issue**: MS Graph tasks created with generic titles, don't use specific genealogical data
- **Impact**: Vague, non-actionable research tasks
- **Evidence**: Tasks titled "Ancestry Follow-up: {username}" instead of specific research actions
- **Priority**: MEDIUM - Affects research productivity

#### **4. Configuration Optimization Opportunities**
- **Issue**: Very conservative processing limits may unnecessarily restrict effectiveness
- **Impact**: Reduced system throughput and research coverage
- **Evidence**: MAX_PAGES=1, BATCH_SIZE=5, 0.5 RPS may be overly restrictive
- **Priority**: MEDIUM - Balance between stability and effectiveness
