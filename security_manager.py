Technical Implementation:
Security Manager for Ancestry.com Automation System
Provides encrypted credential storage and secure session management.

OVERVIEW:
=========
The SecurityManager class provides secure storage and retrieval of sensitive credentials
such as usernames, passwords, and API keys. It uses industry-standard encryption (Fernet)
and integrates with the system keyring for master key storage.

KEY FEATURES:
=============
- Encrypted credential storage using cryptography.fernet
- System keyring integration for master key management
- Secure file permissions (0o600 on Unix systems)
- Comprehensive validation and error handling
- Multiple instance support with shared credential files

TESTING INFORMATION:
====================
This module includes a comprehensive test suite with 10 test categories that verify
all aspects of secure credential management. The test suite follows the project's
standardized testing framework.

Expected Test Output:
- ✅ All 10 tests should pass
- ⚠️ 1 expected warning about file permissions on Windows
- 🕐 Test completion time: ~0.2 seconds

Expected Warnings During Testing:
1. "File permissions: 0o666" - Windows doesn't support Unix-style permissions
2. "Could not retrieve master key from keyring" - Expected on first run
3. Validation errors are intentionally suppressed during invalid credential tests

USAGE EXAMPLE:
==============
```python
from security_manager import SecurityManager

# Initialize manager
manager = SecurityManager("MyApp")

# Store credentials
credentials = {
    "USERNAME": "user@example.com",
    "PASSWORD": "secure_password",
    "API_KEY": "sk-api123456"
}
manager.encrypt_credentials(credentials)

# Retrieve specific credential
username = manager.get_credential("USERNAME")

# Validate credentials
is_valid = manager.validate_credentials(credentials)

# Clean up
manager.delete_credentials()
```

SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS:
========================
- Master keys are stored in the system keyring when available
- Credential files use restrictive permissions (owner-only access)
- All encryption uses Fernet (symmetric encryption with authentication)
- Temporary keys are used when keyring is unavailable (session-only)
- Input validation prevents empty or missing required credentials

ERROR HANDLING:
===============
- Graceful degradation when system keyring is unavailable
- Proper cleanup of temporary files during testing
- Comprehensive validation with clear error messages
- Exception handling with detailed logging for debugging

# ==============================================


def security_manager_module_tests() -> bool:
    """
    Comprehensive test suite for security_manager.py.
    Tests secure credential storage, encryption, and session management.

    EXPECTED WARNINGS/ERRORS:
    ========================

    1. Keyring Access Warnings:
       - "Could not retrieve master key from keyring: [error]"
       - Common on systems without GUI keyring or first-time use
       - These are expected and handled gracefully by generating new keys

    2. File Permission Warnings:
       - "File permissions: [octal_value]"
       - On Windows, Unix-style file permissions (0o600) may not apply
       - The test still passes as security is best-effort on different platforms

    3. Validation Test Errors (Expected and Suppressed):
       - Invalid credential tests intentionally trigger validation failures
       - These errors are suppressed with suppress_logging() context manager
       - Tests verify that invalid credentials properly return False

    4. System-Specific Behaviors:
       - Master key storage may fail on systems without keyring support
       - File deletion may show different behaviors on network drives
       - Encryption file paths may vary between operating systems

    5. Test Environment Warnings:
       - Temporary test files are created and cleaned up during testing
       - Some tests may show "credentials won't persist" warnings for temporary keys
       - Multiple instance tests intentionally overwrite files to test shared behavior

    SUCCESS CRITERIA:
    ================
    - All 10 test categories should pass
    - Only 1-2 expected warnings about file permissions or keyring access
    - No critical errors or unhandled exceptions
    - Test cleanup should remove all temporary files

# =============================================================================
# DEVELOPER EXAMPLES AND USAGE PATTERNS
# =============================================================================

"""
BASIC USAGE EXAMPLES:
====================

1. Simple Credential Storage:
   ```python
   from security_manager import SecurityManager

   manager = SecurityManager("MyApplication")

   # Store credentials
   creds = {
       "ANCESTRY_USERNAME": "user@example.com",
       "ANCESTRY_PASSWORD": "my_secure_password"
   }
   manager.encrypt_credentials(creds)

   # Later retrieve credentials
   stored_creds = manager.decrypt_credentials()
   username = manager.get_credential("ANCESTRY_USERNAME")
   ```

2. Multiple API Keys:
   ```python
   manager = SecurityManager("APIManager")

   api_credentials = {
       "OPENAI_API_KEY": "sk-openai123...",
       "DEEPSEEK_API_KEY": "sk-deepseek456...",
       "GOOGLE_API_KEY": "AIza789..."
   }
   manager.encrypt_credentials(api_credentials)

   # Retrieve specific API key
   openai_key = manager.get_credential("OPENAI_API_KEY")
   ```

3. Credential Validation:
   ```python
   manager = SecurityManager("ValidatedApp")

   # Check if required credentials exist and are valid
   required_creds = {
       "ANCESTRY_USERNAME": "user@domain.com",
       "ANCESTRY_PASSWORD": "password123"
   }

   if manager.validate_credentials(required_creds):
       print("Credentials are valid!")
       manager.encrypt_credentials(required_creds)
   else:
       print("Missing or invalid credentials")
   ```

4. Error Handling:
   ```python
   manager = SecurityManager("RobustApp")

   try:
       # Attempt to retrieve credentials
       creds = manager.decrypt_credentials()
       if creds is None:
           print("No credentials found - first time setup needed")
           # Handle first-time setup...
       else:
           username = manager.get_credential("USERNAME")
           if username is None:
               print("USERNAME not found in stored credentials")
   except Exception as e:
       print(f"Error accessing credentials: {e}")
   ```

5. Cleanup and Management:
   ```python
   manager = SecurityManager("TemporaryApp")

   # Store temporary credentials
   temp_creds = {"TEMP_TOKEN": "abc123"}
   manager.encrypt_credentials(temp_creds)

   # Use credentials...

   # Clean up when done
   manager.delete_credentials()
   ```

INTEGRATION PATTERNS:
====================

1. Configuration Class Integration:
   ```python
   class AppConfig:
       def __init__(self):
           self.security_manager = SecurityManager("MyApp")
           self.credentials = self.security_manager.decrypt_credentials()

       def get_ancestry_credentials(self):
           return {
               "username": self.security_manager.get_credential("ANCESTRY_USERNAME"),
               "password": self.security_manager.get_credential("ANCESTRY_PASSWORD")
           }
   ```

2. Context Manager Pattern:
   ```python
   from contextlib import contextmanager

   @contextmanager
   def secure_credentials(app_name):
       manager = SecurityManager(app_name)
       try:
           yield manager
       finally:
           # Optional: cleanup on exit
           pass

   # Usage:
   with secure_credentials("MyApp") as manager:
       creds = manager.decrypt_credentials()
       # Use credentials...
   ```

TESTING YOUR INTEGRATION:
========================

When integrating SecurityManager into your code, test these scenarios:

1. First-time setup (no existing credentials)
2. Normal operation (credentials exist and are valid)
3. Corrupted credential file handling
4. Missing keyring support
5. Invalid credential validation
6. Multiple application instances

Run the test suite to ensure everything works:
```bash
python security_manager.py
```

SECURITY BEST PRACTICES:
========================

1. Always validate credentials before storing them
2. Use specific application names to avoid conflicts
3. Handle the case where keyring is unavailable
4. Clean up test credentials after testing
5. Never log actual credential values
6. Use environment variables for CI/CD testing
7. Regularly rotate stored credentials
